# Dosing Machine Automation Project

This project presents a fully integrated automation solution for an industrial dosing machine, combining PLC programming, electrical design, and HMI visualization.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- 3-phase motor control (13.7 kW total power)
- PLC logic in CODESYS using Structured Text + CFC
- Finite State Machine (FSM) logic for dosing process
- Load cell integration (4–20 mA analog)
- Relay-based 24VDC actuator control
- HMI visualization for real-time operation
- Circuit breaker & power cable sizing

## 📁 Project Contents
- `Dosing_Machine.pdf` – Full documentation
- `images/` – FSM, HMI, circuit, and wiring images
- `codesys-project/` – PLC program logic as text
